This repository was created for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains all the files required for the successful completion of the Course Project.

The files include:

  •	README.md: This is the file that you are currently reading. It contains a brief overview of the repository.
  
  •	CodeBook.md: This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
  
  •	run_analysis.R: Script that does the following:
  
    o	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    o	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    o	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    o	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    o	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
  •	TidyDataSet.txt: contains the resulting tidy data after running the R script
