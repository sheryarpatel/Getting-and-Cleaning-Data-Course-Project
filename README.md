Created By: Sheryar Patel

This repository was created for the Getting and Cleaning Data course project. It contains all the files required for the successful completion of the Course Project.

The files include:

  •	README.md: This is the file that you are currently reading. It contains a brief overview of the repository.
  
  •	CodeBook.md: This file describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.
  
  •	run_analysis.R: Script that does the following:
  
    o	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    o	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
    o	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    o	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    o	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
    
  •	TidyDataSet.txt: contains the resulting tidy data after running the R script



To run the script simply download the run_analysis.R script, load it into R Studio and run it. The script does everything automatically including download and unzipping of all files.
